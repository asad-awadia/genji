# Contributing

Below, you'll find guidelines on how to contribute effectively.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to Chai:

### Reporting a Bug

If you encounter a bug while using Chai, please help us by reporting it. To do so, follow these steps:

  - Open a new issue.
  - Provide essential information:
    - Chai version you are using
    - Detailed description of the observed behavior
    - Description of the expected behavior
    - If possible, include code examples or a link to a Go playground illustrating the issue.

### Proposing an SQL Feature or Design Change

If you have an idea for an SQL feature or a significant design change, we appreciate your input. To propose such a change, follow these steps:

  - Open an issue to describe the SQL feature or design change you'd like to propose.
  - Engage in a discussion with the project maintainers and contributors to refine your proposal.
  - If necessary, an RFC (Request for Comments) document will be created to document the proposal in detail.
  - Once the proposal is accepted, a designated contributor will create a Pull Request (PR) to implement it.

Please note that the level of involvement in the RFC and PR process may vary depending on the complexity and significance of the feature. We encourage everyone to contribute and will try to accommodate your contributions.

### Other Contributions

Chai can benefit from various contributions beyond bug reports and feature proposals. You can contribute by:

  - Improving Continuous Integration (CI) and tooling.
  - Enhancing Go APIs.
  - Updating documentation.
  - Adding support for new build targets.
  - Improving performance.

To contribute in these areas, follow these general steps:

  - Open an issue to discuss your proposed contribution.
  - Collaborate with project maintainers and contributors to plan and refine your solution.
  - Open a Pull Request (PR) to propose your solution to the problem.

For minor changes like straightforward bug fixes, you may directly open a PR.
